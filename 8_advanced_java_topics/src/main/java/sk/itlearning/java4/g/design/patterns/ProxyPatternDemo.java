	 * application allows users to view images, but loading large images from a
	 * remote server takes time and consumes bandwidth. You want to make the
	 * application more efficient by delaying the loading of these large images
	 * until the user actually tries to view them. Without doing this, the
	 * application will be slow to respond because it will load all images upfront,
	 * which isnâ€™t optimal.

		 * Solution - The proxy pattern can be used to handle this scenario by creating
		 * a proxy image that acts as a stand-in for the real image. The proxy will only
		 * load the actual image when it's needed (i.e., when the user clicks on it to
		 * view). Until that moment, the proxy image can display a placeholder or
		 * perform other lightweight tasks.
