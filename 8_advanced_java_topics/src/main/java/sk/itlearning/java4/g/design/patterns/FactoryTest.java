/**
 *
 * Design patterns represent the best practices used by experienced
 * object-oriented software developers.
 *
 * Design patterns are solutions to general problems that software developers
 * faced during software development.
 *
 * These solutions were obtained by trial and error by numerous software
 * developers over quite a substantial period of time.

 * <tbody>
 * <tr>
 * <td>1</td>
 * <td><b>Creational Patterns</b><br>
 * These design patterns provides way to create objects while hiding the
 * creation logic, rather than instantiating objects directly using new
 * operator. This gives program more flexibility in deciding which objects need
 * to be created for a given use case.</td>
 * </tr>
 * <tr>
 * <td>2</td>
 * <td><b>Structural Patterns</b><br>
 * These design patterns concern class and object composition. Concept of
 * inheritance is used to compose interfaces and define ways to compose objects
 * to obtain new functionalities.</td>
 * </tr>
 * <tr>
 * <td>3</td>
 * <td><b>Behavioral Patterns</b><br>
 * These design patterns are specifically concerned with communication between
 * objects.</td>

 * <tr>
 * <td>4</td>
 * <td><b>J2EE Patterns</b><br>
 * These design patterns are specifically concerned with the presentation tier.
 * These patterns are identified by Sun Java Center.</td>
